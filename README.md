## Assignment Submission & Review App

### Requirements

A student should be able to login to our application and see a dashboard that outlines the following info:

- What assignments are due, and when
- (perhaps) a page to review past assignment submissions
- Status of an assignment that's currently under review and if it needs tweaking
- A way to submit (or re-submit) an assignment for review

When submitting an assignment, the student will be asked to provide the following info:

- GitHub URL to public Repo
- Which branch is the correct one

Once submitted, the status updates from "pending submission" -> "submitted"

Bonus Feature: leverage GitHub API to verify if a URL points to a public repo, and get a list of branches to populate the "branch" dropdown

Once a student has submitted an assignment, an email notification should be sent to all active code
reviewers letting them know that a new code review is ready. The first code reviewer to claim
the review will be able to start working on it (and now it's unavailable to others for review).

Once a code reviewer has claimed a submitted assignment, the status changes from
"submitted" -> "in review"

Bonus Feature: if a code reviewer has claimed a review and hasn't completed it within 24 hours it is sent back to the previous status, and anyone can claim it.
  
A code reviewer can reject a code review if it doesn't satisfy the assignment's criteria.
When a code reviewer rejects an assignment, the status will change from "submitted" -> "needs update"
When this happens, a notification will be sent to the student telling them they need to do
more work on that assignment. Once they've done their work, they can revisit that assignment
for re-submission (perhaps prompt them to make sure they've pushed their changes).
When a student re-submits an assignment, they will be given a chance to change their github url + branch, then it will move from "needs updating" -> "in review" and get assigned back to the same code reviewer. A notification will be sent to the code reviewer.

When a code reviewer has successfully completed their review, they will be able to submit
their finished review (by adding a URL to a video recording) and then a notification
will be sent back to the student. The status will change from "in review" -> "completed"

Also, for each cohort of students, we will need to have an API that allows for an
Admin role to create user accounts

Notifies code reviewers for reviews that are sitting stagnant and waiting for review
Notifies students if their rejected assignments are still needing tweaking
